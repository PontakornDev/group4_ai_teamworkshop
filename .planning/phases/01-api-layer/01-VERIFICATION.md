# Phase 1: API Layer Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** The backend API endpoints exist and work — dog images can be fetched and swipes can be saved and read
**Verified:** 2026-05-08T02:47:30Z
**Status:** human_needed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

**Note on MVP mode:** ROADMAP.md marks Phase 1 as `mode: mvp`, but the phase goal is not in User Story format (`As a [role], I want to [capability], so that [outcome]`). The PLAN.md does contain a properly formatted User Story on line 65. ROADMAP Success Criteria are explicit and unambiguous — verification proceeds against those criteria using standard goal-backward methodology.

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | GET /api/dog returns a JSON response with a valid image URL (jpg/png) and extracted dogId | VERIFIED | `app/api/dog/route.ts`: fetches `https://random.dog/woof.json`, returns `{url, dogId}`. 4/4 unit tests pass (image URL, mp4 retry, 5-attempt exhaustion, webp). |
| 2 | GET /api/dog never returns a .mp4 URL — it retries until an image is found | VERIFIED | `app/api/dog/route.ts` lines 16-28: `IMAGE_EXTENSIONS` allowlist + `MAX_ATTEMPTS = 5` loop; returns 500 after exhaustion. Test confirms exactly 5 fetch calls on all-.mp4 sequence. |
| 3 | POST /api/swipe with a valid body upserts /data/swipes.json and returns the updated DogRecord | VERIFIED | `app/api/swipe/route.ts`: validates all 4 fields, calls `appendAction(dogId, imageUrl, username, action)`, returns DogRecord with col array. Integration test confirms upsert + response shape. |
| 4 | GET /api/history returns the full list of DogRecord entries from /data/swipes.json | VERIFIED | `app/api/history/route.ts`: calls `readDogs()` and returns the array. Returns `[]` on fresh install. POST→GET e2e test confirms record appears with col entry. |

**Score:** 4/4 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `lib/storage.ts` | Shared bootstrap-aware JSON I/O — exports `ensureStore`, `readDogs`, `findUnseenDog`, `appendAction`, `DogRecord`, `SwipeAction` | VERIFIED | All exports present, grouped-schema DogRecord, findUnseenDog+appendAction upsert. Imported by dog, swipe, and history routes. |
| `app/api/dog/route.ts` | GET /api/dog — random.dog fetch with retry | VERIFIED | 29 lines, real implementation with `IMAGE_EXTENSIONS`, `MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `extractDogId`. Exports `GET`. |
| `app/api/swipe/route.ts` | POST /api/swipe — saves swipe record to disk | VERIFIED | 37 lines, full input validation (4 fields), server-generated timestamp, calls `appendSwipe`. Exports `POST` only (no GET — correct per D-01). |
| `app/api/history/route.ts` | GET /api/history — reads all swipe records | VERIFIED | 7 lines, calls `readSwipes()`, returns result. Exports `GET`. |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|-----|-----|--------|---------|
| `app/api/dog/route.ts` | `https://random.dog/woof.json` | `fetch(RANDOM_DOG_URL, {cache:'no-store'})` | WIRED | `RANDOM_DOG_URL = "https://random.dog/woof.json"` on line 3; `fetch(RANDOM_DOG_URL, ...)` on line 17. woof.json is referenced. |
| `app/api/dog/route.ts` | `lib/storage.ts` | `findUnseenDog(username)` | WIRED | `import { findUnseenDog } from "@/lib/storage"`; called when username query param present before random.dog fetch. |
| `app/api/swipe/route.ts` | `lib/storage.ts` | `appendAction(dogId, imageUrl, username, action)` | WIRED | `import { appendAction } from "@/lib/storage"`; upserts DogRecord, pushes SwipeAction into col. |
| `app/api/history/route.ts` | `lib/storage.ts` | `readDogs()` | WIRED | `import { readDogs } from "@/lib/storage"`; returns DogRecord[]. |

### Data-Flow Trace (Level 4)

| Artifact | Data Variable | Source | Produces Real Data | Status |
|----------|--------------|--------|--------------------|--------|
| `app/api/dog/route.ts` | `data.url`, `data.dogId` | `fetch(RANDOM_DOG_URL)` → `res.json()` | Yes — real HTTP fetch to external API | FLOWING (mocked in tests; needs live smoke test — see Human Verification) |
| `app/api/swipe/route.ts` | `saved` (SwipeRecord) | `appendSwipe(record)` → `lib/storage.ts` → disk | Yes — `fs.writeFile` to `data/swipes.json` | FLOWING (mocked cwd in tests; needs live smoke test — see Human Verification) |
| `app/api/history/route.ts` | `records` (SwipeRecord[]) | `readSwipes()` → `lib/storage.ts` → `fs.readFile` | Yes — reads real disk file | FLOWING (mocked cwd in tests; needs live smoke test) |

### Behavioral Spot-Checks

| Behavior | Command | Result | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| All 22 unit/integration tests pass | `npm test` | `Test Files 3 passed (3), Tests 22 passed (22)` | PASS |
| No GET handler on /api/swipe (D-01) | `grep "export async function GET" app/api/swipe/route.ts` | 0 matches | PASS |
| /data/ in .gitignore | `grep "/data/" .gitignore` | Found at line 44 | PASS |
| Server-side timestamp generated | Code read: line 32 of swipe/route.ts | `timestamp: new Date().toISOString()` confirmed | PASS |
| Live API call to random.dog | Cannot run — requires server start | N/A | SKIP (routed to human) |
| Real disk write at production cwd | Cannot run — requires server start | N/A | SKIP (routed to human) |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| DOG-01 | 01-01-PLAN.md | App fetches a random dog image URL from random.dog API and extracts the dogId | SATISFIED | `app/api/dog/route.ts` fetches `woof.json`, extracts dogId via `split('/').pop().replace(/\.[^.]+$/, '')`. 4 unit tests pass. |
| DOG-02 | 01-01-PLAN.md | API route retries automatically if random.dog returns a non-image URL (.mp4) | SATISFIED | `IMAGE_EXTENSIONS` allowlist + `MAX_ATTEMPTS = 5` retry loop. Test confirms 5 fetch calls before 500. |
| SWIPE-01 | 01-01-PLAN.md | POST /api/swipe upserts swipes.json — appends {username, action, timestamp} to dog's col array | SATISFIED | `app/api/swipe/route.ts` validates all fields, calls `appendAction()`, returns DogRecord. Integration test confirms upsert+response. |
| SWIPE-02 | 01-01-PLAN.md | GET /api/history reads all records from /data/swipes.json | SATISFIED | `app/api/history/route.ts` calls `readSwipes()`. Returns `[]` on fresh install. POST→GET test confirms record retrieval. |

No orphaned requirements found — all 4 IDs from the PLAN frontmatter are accounted for and have implementation evidence.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| `lib/storage.ts` | 26-27 | `JSON.parse(raw)` without try/catch | Info | Corrupt `swipes.json` would throw an unhandled error. Acknowledged in SUMMARY threat surface scan (T-01-05 deferred). Prototype-acceptable for Phase 1. |

No TODO/FIXME/placeholder comments found. No stub returns (null, [], {}) in rendering paths. No empty handlers.

## Human Verification Required

### 1. Live random.dog Fetch

**Test:** Start `npm run dev`, then run `curl http://localhost:3000/api/dog`
**Expected:** HTTP 200 with JSON `{"url": "https://random.dog/<id>.<ext>", "dogId": "<id>"}` where `<ext>` is jpg, jpeg, png, gif, or webp — never .mp4. The `fileSizeBytes` field must be absent.
**Why human:** All unit tests mock `global.fetch`. The real random.dog API has never been called in this codebase. The phase goal states "dog images **can be fetched**" — this requires an actual live network request to confirm.

### 2. Real Disk Persistence Round-Trip

**Test:** With dev server running, execute:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/swipe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"dogId":"test123","imageUrl":"https://random.dog/test123.jpg","action":"like","username":"alice"}'

curl http://localhost:3000/api/history

cat data/swipes.json
```
**Expected:** POST returns 200 with `{dogId, imageUrl, col: [{username, action, timestamp}]}`. GET /api/history returns `[{dogId:"test123", imageUrl:"...", col:[{username:"alice", action:"like", timestamp:"..."}]}]`. `data/swipes.json` file exists on disk at the project root with the grouped record written (directory auto-created if it didn't exist).
**Why human:** Tests mock `process.cwd()` to a temp directory. Production cwd behavior — creating `/data/` directory and writing to `swipes.json` in the actual project root — has never been exercised end-to-end.

## Gaps Summary

No gaps found. All 4 must-have truths are VERIFIED, all artifacts are substantive and properly wired, all 4 requirement IDs are satisfied, and no blocker anti-patterns were detected.

Status is `human_needed` (not `passed`) because two items require a running dev server to confirm:
1. That the real random.dog external API returns data in the expected shape and the retry logic handles live .mp4 responses.
2. That production-cwd disk I/O actually creates `/data/swipes.json` and persists records.

These are standard external-service and disk I/O concerns that unit tests with mocks cannot substitute for.
